                Tip 1: Lighting
              </p>
              <p class = "articleWords">
                The importance of light in photography is immense. Light is everywhere and in photography, light plays a crucial role in delivering highlights, tones, shadows and contrast. Without good lighting, be it artificial or natural, a photo would typically fail to bring out details and set contents in a photo apart from one another . This results in photos that appear plain and stale. Lighting is the idiom and vocabulary to your photographs. Start looking out for lighting in your photographs, they are sure to make your picture a whole lot more interesting.

                Tip 2: Colours
              </p>
              <p class = "articleWords">
                Similar to light, colours are everywhere. They are also a key component in defining whether your photos would make or break. Colours are the universal language for mood and is efficient in evoking the theme of your photographs. So when shooting, look out for interesting colours that would complement your subject and at the same time, bring out the intended mood.

                Tip 3: Intention
              </p>
              <p class = "articleWords">
                Photography is all about being intentional. While true that photography is an artistic skill and a way of creative expression, it is not restrained to the talented few people in this world. Photography is a skill that could be learnt and mastered, but that is only when one starts to be intentional about crafting their photographs, including everything from the subject to their expression to the lighting and the kind of environment they are in. Being intentional in photography is an attitude. Do not be afraid to make mistakes, making consistent and intentional changes to your photography routine/practice leads to trial and error, and eventually, you would be able to see the fruits of your labor in your photographs. In short, be intentional about what you are doing.
