                The art of minimalism has been with us for ages, but during the past 3 years, there is an ignition of photos belonging to the minimalist category and an influx of minimal images took the world by storm, flooding into our websites, magazines and posters. This is largely due to the increasing popularity of Instagram, a mobile application focused on bringing photographers all over the world to come together and form a community. Instagram eventually thrived into a community of mobile photographers, but due to mobile camera limitations, especially the lack of optical zoom, photographers were challenged to take shots without the use of depth of field, thus, minimalism in photography was ignited, embody clean and simple details. In the following two paragraphs, I am going to give you two essential tips to help kickstart you for the field of minimalist photography.

                Tip 1: Change Your Perspective
              </p>
              <p class = "articleWords">
                I have been shooting minimalist photographs for over the past three years, and though I am not close to perfection (in fact, far from it), experience tells me that to shoot minimalist photos, one has to change their perspective. Firstly, you need to expose yourself to your favourite form of minimalist photographs. In short, follow instagrammers who shoots minimalist photographs that inspires you. Doing so and viewing their post daily is crucial in shaping your perception of minimalist photography. Secondly, stop cluttering. Less is more. Look out for elements like colours, lines, people and shapes that are clean and simple. This is a stepping stone to shaping your perception of minimalist photography. Lastly before we go on to the second tip, look out for a story to tell. Minimalist photographs thrives because they are able to tell stories in a visually attractive yet superbly simple way. This is the wow factor. In a nutshell, find a story to tell, make use of comparative elements like a small human and a large environment to tell a story in a vast yet minimal manner, leaving your viewers to their astonishment. Let us go on to the next tip.

                Yes, you read it right, practice. The key to all photo genres is practice and minimalist photography is definitely no exception. Do not be afraid to make mistakes. After every shot, evaluate on how there could improve your shots. With experience gained from your mistakes, you form a stronger perception of minimalist photography. Also, shoot more on your mobile device. The lack of zoom and depth of field would be helpful in helping you to spot out minimalist traits in your subjects or its environment.
